# Private Events

The second project of the Associations projects of [The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations).

The project is a private adaptation to the [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) which allows user to create events and send invitations and parties

The project doesn't use complicated sign-in methods, using only email without password, allowing users to create basic events and attend events upon invitation.
